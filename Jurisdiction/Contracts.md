**Contracts** are agreements which two or more individuals agree upon which generally involve the exchange or multiple goods, services and/or currency. **Contracts** and their terms are enforceable by the [[Government]] (meaning it is a [[Crime]] to break them).

**Contracts** contain multiple key elements, some of which are required:
- Terms of the agreement: what [[Citizen|Citizens]] are agreeing on
- Termination statement: a statement which explains when the **Contract** will be terminated via completion and/or failure.
- (Optional) Failure conditions: the conditions which apply if the terms of the contract are failed to be met.
- (Optional) Due Date: the date the terms of the **Contract** must be met. 

For a **Contract** to be official (enforceable by the [[Government]]) a contract must be:
1. Signed (in book) with the name of the **Contract** creator by the **Contract** creator.
2. Reviewed by an [[Elected Officials#Elected Official|Elected Official]] and signed (in book) with the name of the [[Elected Officials#Elected Official|Elected Official]] reviewer by the  [[Elected Officials#Elected Official|Elected Official]] reviewer.
3. Reviewed by an all **Contract** members and signed (in book) with the name of the **Contract** members by the **Contract** members. The last member to receive the book should sign the actual book closed.
4. The book must be passed to all **Contract** members including the creator to ensure it has not been modified. In the case it has been modified, the **Contract** is terminated immediately.
5. The book must be passed to the [[Elected Officials#Elected Official|Elected Official]] reviewer to hold the book and keep members accountable for the **Contract**.
