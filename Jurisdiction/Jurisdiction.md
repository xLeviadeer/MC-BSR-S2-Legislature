**Jurisdiction** is the idea of having a set of regulations which are enforced by a specific task force working under or as part of the [[Government]]. 

Regulations change depending on what kind of [[Land]] a player is inside of:
- [[Land#Free Land|Free Land]] has no regulations
- [[Land#Soft Land|Soft Land]] and [[Land#Spawn Land|Spawn Land]] are regulated via [[#Soft Jurisdiction]] in addition to [[#General Land Jurisdiction]]
- [[Land#Hard Land|Hard Land]] is regulated via [[#Hard Jurisdiction]] in addition to [[#General Land Jurisdiction]]
All [[Property#Jurisdictional Property|Jurisdictional Property]] has multiple types of [[Property]] which have their own specific regulations in addition to the [[Land]] regulations.
