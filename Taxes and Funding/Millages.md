**Millages** are [[Taxes|tax]] increases which must be voted on by [[Citizen|Citizens]] where funding is strictly used to complete a specific [[Assignments#Public Assignments|Public Project]].

---
## How Millages Effect Taxes
**Millages** are applied after all other [[Taxes]], as part of the "Tax Increases" (after [[Taxes#Circumstantial Tax Value|Circumstantial Tax Value]]). **Milllages** are generally a percentage but can also be a flat amount, however it's encouraged to use the percentage option to ensure all [[Citizen|Citizens]] can afford the **Millage**.

## Fund Usage Requirement
The funds acquired through a **Millage** must be used by the [[Government]] to fund the [[Assignments#Projects|Project]] that was initially agreed on. It is considered a [[Crime]] to move funds acquired from a **Millage** to a different goal.

---
## Citizen Voting
All [[Citizen|Citizens]] must have the ability to vote for or against a **Millage**. A **Millage** vote cannot be open for less than 12 real hours before it is able to be rejected or accepted. When a **Millage** is rejected (by majority) it is discarded and cannot be inquired about via [[Citizen]] vote for for 7 real days. When a **Millage** is accepted the [[Taxes|tax]] increase is applied to all [[Taxes]] and the [[Assignments#Projects|Project]] must be set up using the **Millage** funding.
