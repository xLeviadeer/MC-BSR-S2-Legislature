**Signage** is the idea that signs must be placed with certain specification standards to inform users of common and/or important themes in [[World|MC:BSR-S2]]. 
## Signage Requirements
It is considered a [[Crime]] of the [[Property Owner]] to not follow all **Signage Requirements**.
1. All **Signage** must be in a [[#Valid Signage Locations|Valid Signage Location]] according to its [[#Property Information Signage vs General Information Signage|information type status]].
2. **Signage** must follow the exact [[#Signage Formatting]] detailed below.

## Valid Signage Locations
**Signage** must be placed in a location or duplicates in multiple locations in order to satisfy the conditions for each type of [[Property]].
#### Property Information Signage vs General Information Signage
**Property Information Signage** is **Signage** that must be posted according to the guidelines below. **General Information Signage** is **Signage** that is posted inside of [[Property]] to inform users about portions of the property, certain objects or rules. This type of **Signage** should be placed as if it were a [[#Private and Shared Private Property Valid Signage Locations|private property]] where the portion of property or focal object is the [[Property#Private Property|Private Property]].
#### Public Property Valid Signage Locations
[[Property#Public Property|Public Property]] doesn't require **Signage** unless it's a portion of a [[Property#Private Property|Private Property]] or [[Property#Shared Private Property|Shared Private Property]] in which case the details of **Signage** are detailed below in [[# Private and Shared Private Property Valid Signage Locations]]
#### Private and Shared Private Property Valid Signage Locations
**Signage** must be placed where [[Citizen|Citizens]] who are not currently inside of the [[Property]] can view the signs and read them. 
- If the [[Property]] has at least 1 obvious entrance with distinct portions which are not entrances:
	- Every entrance to the [[Property]] must have all relevant **Signage**.
- If the [[Property]] has no entrances:
	- One set of relevant **Signage** must be constructed on the structure exterior in an obvious location.
- If the [[Property]] is all entrances (has no distinct entrances):
	- A [[Property]] line must be constructed in the ground, in the air or in the water which details where the edge of the property of is. This line can be constructed on the [[Property]] border [[Property Owner#Edge Spacing|rather than 1 block in]]. All relevant **Signage** must be placed on the property line for each cardinal direction. If **Signage** appears more than 24 blocks away from each other on the property line, a new set of relevant **Signage** must be placed to make the distance shorter than 24 blocks.
If a portion of the [[Property]] is public and a portion is private then the same rules as stated above must be true for both the private and public portions. Where the transition from public to private must have **Signage** but the transition from private to public does not require **Signage**.
#### (Shared) Private Property Construction Valid Signage Locations
If a [[Property#Private Property|Private Property]] or [[Property#Shared Private Property|Shared Private Property]] is under construction on it's borders which would cause the [[Property]] line to become difficult to determine, then place **Signage** of form [[#(Shared) Private Property Under Construction Signage]] according to the locational specifications in [[#Private and Shared Private Property Valid Signage Locations]]
#### Unowned and Owned Property Valid Signage Locations
[[Property#Unowned Property|Unowned Property]] must have all relevant **Signage** in it's center-point or focal location.

## Defining Extra Information Alongside Regular Signage
A [[Property Owner]] may define extra information about their [[Property]]. Extra information must be placed in [[#Valid Signage Locations]]. Extra information must be the same color as the property rule that it regards for it to be legally valid.
> [!example]
> Defining that, "users who trespass will be issued with a 10 Diamond [[Fines|Fine]]" must be placed next to the regulated [[#Private Property Signage]] and be in red, glowing ink. 

Extra information which pertains to a legal rule, such as shown in the example above, must be negotiated with a [[Elected Officials#Elected Official|Elected Official]] before being officialized. The sign should not glow until it is officialized. It is considered a [[Crime]] to glow a sign before it has been officialized. Glow ink will not be provided. Writing a rule in the form detailed in the example allows the book-work to be skipped when the rule is broken because the rule negotiation has already been completed.

## Sign Color Meanings
**Signage** has particular colors to signal certain ideas. [[Property Owner]] should attempt to avoid using colors for signs which are already bound when possible to avoid confusion. If a sign is confused to be part of a rule due to it's color and formatting when it is, in fact, not legal then the [[Property Owner]] may be punished with [[Crime#Criminal Punishments|Criminal Punishment]].

Unbound in this case means that there is no current meaning for the color
==Red: no trespassing==
==Orange: no trespassing, some [[Citizen|Citizens]] allowed== 
==Yellow: entry allowed==
Green: unbound
==Lime: non-legally enforceable rule==
Cyan: unbound
Light Blue: unbound
==Blue: additional information==
Purple: unbound
Magenta: unbound
Pink: unbound
White: unbound, typically used for locational names
Light Gray: unbound
Gray: unbound
Black: unbound, typically used for locational names
Brown: unbound

Generally speaking, regarding information type:
Red: property
Orange: property
Yellow: property
lime: general
blue: general
white: general
black: general
