  - Purchase Land
---
To purchase land, a **Citizen** must speak to an [[Elected Officials#Elected Official|Elected Official]] or in the case of the prospective purchaser being an [[Elected Officials#Elected Official|Elected Official]] they must determine if the [[Land]] is a [[Property#Large Property|Large Property]] and will hence require a [[Governmental Meetings|Governmental Meeting]].

The price of land is decided by taking the [[Property#Property Metric|Property Metric]] and dividing it by 4, ceilinged to an integer.
> [!math]
> $$ \begin{align*}
> & m = \text{property metric} \\
> & n = \lceil \frac{m}{4} \rceil 
> \end{align*} $$

The [[Elected Officials#Elected Official|Elected Official]] will either allocate the land or schedule a [[Governmental Meetings|Governmental Meeting]] to determine if land can be allocated. If land allocation was successful the [[Elected Officials#Elected Official|Elected Official]] must receive payment for the new [[Property]] and submit it into the [[Treasure]] (via the [[Treasure#Treasurer|Treasurer]]).

All [[Signage#Signage Requirements|Signage Requirements]] must be met for the [[Property]] to be valid.

## Land Anti-Mutilation Incentive
The **Land Anti-Mutilation Incentive** works to stop land from being mutilated and instead to incentivize [[Citizen|Citizens]] to build "with the land". If prospectively purchased [[Land]] will be flattened before it is constructed on, depending on the severity of flattening, the price of land is increased. 

For every block of variance (each [[Terminology Around Coordinates|Y]] level) removed for construction before becoming level increases (adds to) the [[Land]] price by 15 Diamonds.
> [!example]
> - Taking 5 blocks off the top of a mountain would cost (15 * 5) 75 Diamonds.
> - Taking [[Land]] which varies in height by 3 blocks and making it flat would cost (15 * 3) 45 Diamonds.

The **Land Anti-Mutilation Incentive** must also be consulted and used to charge [[Citizen|Citizens]] when changes to land flatness are prospected after property purchase.
