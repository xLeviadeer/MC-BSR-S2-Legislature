**Land** refers to all blocks in [[World|MC:BSR-S2]] divided by [[Jurisdiction|jurisdictional properties]]. **Land** is divided into 2 categories in [[World|MC:BSR-S2]]: [[#Free Land]] and [[#Jurisdictional Land]].
## Free Land
**Free Land** is **Land** that is not [[#Jurisdictional Land]] where players have no rules to follow aside from the [[Game Rules]].
The End is considered **Free Land**.
The Nether is mostly considered **Free Land**, however, portions of the Nether are considered [[Property#Unowned Property|Unowned Property]].

## Jurisdictional Land
**Jurisdictional Land** is [[Landarea#Surface Landarea|Surface Landarea]] **Land** that has [[Jurisdiction|jurisdictional properties]] aka rules. Players who enter **Jurisdictional Land** must follow all rules set for it or else they are subject to [[Crime#Criminal Punishments|Criminal Punishment]].

**Jurisdictional Land** includes and refers to multiple categories of **Land**:
- [[#Hard Land]]
- [[#Soft Land]]
- [[#Spawn Land]]

**Jurisdictional Land** (including [[#Hard Land]], [[#Soft Land]] and [[#Spawn Land]]) may sometimes extend below [[Landarea#Surface Landarea|Surface Landarea]] if a [[Subsurface Land Provisions|Subsurface Land Provision]] has been granted to a particular [[Property]]. Proper [[Signage]] must be placed by the [[Property Owner]] or [[Government]] in this case.

### Hard Land
**Hard Land** and the Build Square Restructure is one of the core ideas of [[World|MC:BSR-S2]]. The Build Square Restructure is the idea of having **Hard Land**. When players enter **Hard Land** they must follow [[Jurisdiction#Hard Jurisdiction|Hard Jurisdiction]].

The Build Square Restructure is named the way it is because it uses a [[#The Build Square|Build Square]] to restructure the way that Minecraft Survival is played.
#### The Build Square
The Build Square is a square in the sky which determines what **Land** has [[Jurisdiction#Hard Jurisdiction|Hard Jurisdiction]] by whatever [[Landarea#Surface Landarea|Surface Landarea]] is under, above and inside it, including the line. This **Land** is called **Hard Land**, Pentonic Land or just the Build Square.
