**Nether Highways** are portions of [[Land]] within the Nether which are owned by the [[Government]] and are hence a sub-type of [[Land#Soft Land|Soft Land]] and follow the [[Jurisdiction]] of [[Land#Soft Land|Soft Land]].

---
## Nether Highway Land
**Nether Highways** are defined as a sub-type of [[Land#Soft Land|Soft Land]]. Rules about what defines the bounds of **Nether Highways** can be found in the [[Land#Nether Highways|nether highways section under soft land]].
#### Nether Highway Access Point
A **Nether Highway** Access Point is a "node" location that is part of [[#Nether Highway Land]] which contains a nether portal. **Nether Highway** Access Points include both Nether Highway Hubs (defined below) and Nether Highway Endpoints (defined below).
##### Nether Highway Hubs
A **Nether Highway** Hub is a type of [[#Nether Highway Access Point]] which branches out to other [[#Nether Highway Access Point|Nether Highway Access Points]].
##### Nether Highway Endpoints
A **Nether Highway** Endpoint is a type of [[#Nether Highway Access Point]] which has no other connections besides one back to a [[#Nether Highway Hubs|Nether Highway Hub]].

Sometimes a **Nether Highway** Endpoint may have a "junction" which is when the path branches without a [[#Nether Highway Hubs|Nether Highway Hub]]. Junctions are considered bad design but are not illegal. Junctions work best when branching to an undefined area. 
## Regulations for Nether Highway Construction
**Nether Highways** must adhere to the following regulations.
#### Tunnel Construction
**Nether Highway** tunnels must be constructed of the following make.
- An *ice tunnel* adjoined to a *walking tunnel* where the bottom block of the *walking tunnel* is an opened crimson trapdoor facing such that when opened it will be aligned with the upper wall of the *ice tunnel*. Trapdoors are not required if they cause unnecessary expense.
- The 3[[Terminology Around Coordinates#**Hori** and **Vert**|Hori]] blocks at the beginning and end of the tunnel should be of size 3[[Terminology Around Coordinates|X]]x3[[Terminology Around Coordinates|Y]]x3[[Terminology Around Coordinates|Z]] and best aligned with the rest of the tunnel with netherrack walls, floor and ceiling which contains two crimson slabs 1 block after where the ice as the floor of the *ice tunnel* ends.
- The entry point to each tunnel should be a vertical tunnel of 2[[Terminology Around Coordinates|X]]x2[[Terminology Around Coordinates|Z]] with ladders on one wall best accessible to the hub entry point they lead to. The bottom of this tunnel should have a floor made of slime blocks.
- The tunnel must be dug where the floor places the player on [[Terminology Around Coordinates|Y]]15. 
- The tunnel must be fully enclosed on all sides besides it's entry/exit points which lead into a **Nether Highway** hub or instead of ending with an entry/exit point the tunnel must end with a **Nether Highway** Endpoint.
A tunnel is exempt from all requirements aside from those regarding that the tunnel must traverse from hubs and endpoints if the length/distance of the tunnel will be/is less than or equal to 50([[Terminology Around Coordinates#**Hori** and **Vert**|Hori]]) blocks or if the tunnel starts, ends, and traverses space that is in [[Land#Hard Land|Hard Land]] in the overworld.

Let *ice tunnel* refer to a tunnel which is of size 2[[Terminology Around Coordinates#**Hori** and **Vert**|Hori]] x 3[[Terminology Around Coordinates#**Hori** and **Vert**|Vert]] with packed ice as the floor and with netherrack walls and ceiling.
Let *walking tunnel* refer to a tunnel which is of size 1[[Terminology Around Coordinates#**Hori** and **Vert**|Hori]] x 2[[Terminology Around Coordinates#**Hori** and **Vert**|Vert]] with netherrack walls, floor and ceiling.
#### Hub Construction
**Nether Highway** hubs have no formal construction requirements other than that
- They resist destruction via external explosions from ghasts.
- They are fully enclosed, where all entry and exit points to the outside have doors.
- Each tunnel that branches from the hub has a label of the facilities it leads to down-stream.
- The hub has a label describing what facility the portal it contains leads to.
Ideally, **Nether Highway** hubs should follow a similar or the same theme so that they can easily be understood by users, however, this is not required.
## Private Nether Tunnel Extensions
The **Nether Highway** can be extended onto for access to [[Property#Owned Property|Owned Property]] at the request of [[Property Owner|Property Owners]]. The **Nether Highway** cannot be extended onto for access to [[Property#Private Property|Private Property]] or [[Property#Shared Private Property|Shared Private Property]]. Extensions must be approved by an [[Elected Officials#Elected Official|Elected Official]].

Extensions must be constructed to follow all [[#Tunnel Construction|tunnel construction regulations]] out of the requestors private resources and no [[Government]] funding. Extensions must label that they lead to [[Property#Unowned Property|Unowned Property]] or label that the associated portal may not be suited for all [[Citizen|Citizens]] to use. Extensions must have one end which ends with an entry/exit to a hub and another end which ends with an endpoint. The endpoint must lead to the [[Property#Unowned Property|Unowned Property]].
## Nether Highway Mapping System
The **Nether Highway** Mapping System is a map designed to represent the **Nether Highway** to make navigation easier. The following is true about the **Nether Highway** Mapping System. 
#### General Mapping Rules
General Mapping Rules apply to both [[#Soft Land Mapping|soft]] and [[#Hard Land Mapping|hard land]] mapping.
- Each **Nether Highway** Hub is represented with a vibrant (concrete) color and marked accordingly in each hub.
- Each **Nether Highway** Endpoint is marked with a dull (terracotta) color or black.
- Tunnels are denoted as light gray lines, darker if leading between hubs and brighter if leading between hub and endpoint.
#### Soft Land Mapping
Soft Land Mapping only applies to the map for [[Land#Soft Land|Soft Land]].
- Each pixel on the map represents 500 blocks of *distance*. A pixel does *not* represent 500 blocks of area. 
-  [[Land#The Build Square|The Build Square]] is denoted as 4 4x4 (pixels) squares. **Nether Highway** Hubs and Endpoints within [[Land#The Build Square|The Build Square]] are not shown on the map and are not marked according to color 
#### Hard Land Mapping
Hard Land Mapping only applies to the map for [[Land#Hard Land|Hard Land]].
- Each pixel on the map represents 25 blocks of *distance*. A pixel does *not* represent 25 blocks of area. 
- [[Land#The Build Square|The Build Square]] is shown as a set of outlines on the map in the corresponding colors.
